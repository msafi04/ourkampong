        <h1><b>About</b></h1>
        <p>
            1. Kampung meaning “village” in the Malay language, kampung culture refers to a neighbourly spirit rooted in the country’s humble past — and 
            one that binds the people of the nation. It often refers to a sense of community where everybody looks out for each other. Good things are 
            shared, and burdens are carried.
        </p>
        <p>
            2. Even though close-knit villages have been replaced by high rise apartments where one can easily live in isolation among thousands, different 
            elements of kampung culture are still perpetuated, and in different ways too.
